Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Scala that allows you to match values against patterns and execute code based on the matched pattern. It's a more expressive and concise way to handle complex conditional logic and is commonly used in functional programming to destructure data.
Pattern matching can be used with various data types, including literals, case classes, tuples, and more. It provides a way to handle different cases in a more elegant and readable manner.
